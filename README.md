Examples from the book "Clojure Programming" by Chas Emerick, Brian Carper, and Christophe Grand

This also uses the gradle clojure plugin [clojuresque](https://github.com/clojuresque/clojuresque)

Need to install [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) for the leiningen but also installs clojure

via homebrew

brew install leiningen

Also need java 7 or higher
